			    <p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">We are heavily focused on Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies and offer a wide breadth of BIM services, including BIM development, clash detection and BIM coordination, as well as BIM Objects and BIM Families development. We have a team of specialist technicians that are experts in Revit, Navisworks and ArchiCAD platforms.</p>
				<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">We work with developers, construction companies, architects, engineers and MEP services to convert designs into accurate BIM models. </p>

				<h3>BIM Development & Modeling</h3>
				<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">BuildBIM technicians develop and model individual consultant BIMs or federated BIMs for all consultants, including As-Built plans. </p>
				<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">If your office is new to BIM or requires extra documentation resources, BuildBIM’s advanced modelling capabilities can help boost your productivity. </p>

				<h3>BIM Coordination</h3>
				<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">We perform clash detection on federated BIM to discover and resolve issues between project consultants. In addition, we amend consultant BIMs based on clash detection results.  </p>
				<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">Once the necessary consultants plans are integrated into the master BIM, clash detection can be conducted typically using Navisworks, and a report developed. Our coordinator will then validate changes with the designer and services. Where modifications are required in the building or system, these issues will be resolved at the virtual construction stage rather than at time of construction. </p>

					<li><b>Resolving Clashes</b></li>
					<li><b>Co-ordination Checking</b></li>

				<h3 class="bump">BIM families for component suppliers & manufacturers</h3>
				<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">We provide parametric models in Revit and ArchiCAD that accurately represent your products and their specifications. These can be developed to varying levels of detail (LOD) to suit your end user’s requirements.  </p>
				<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">The modelling of BIM components is the virtual creation of different construction products in BIM language. These are 3D digital representations of any construction product with the advantage that they come associated with all the provider information, e.g. price, product codes, technical specifications, recommendation for installation etc. BIM designers may employ these digital files into their project, specifying exact products and quantities, giving suppliers with BIM specified content a significant competitive advantage. </p>

				<h3>CAD services for component suppliers & manufacturers:</h3>
				<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">Documentation of product and systems in any 2D format for use and reference by specifiers, designers and installers.  </p>

				<h3>CAD or As-Builts to BIM </h3>
				<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">BuildBIM can convert 2D drawings and documentation or As-Built markups to BIM models using Revit, ArchiCAD and MEP software. This gives contractors the benefits of BIM when they are supplied only with 2D information. Our service can be utilized to prepare BIM models for the purpose of BIM based facility management, creating a virtual representation of the design for clash detection, scheduling, and visualizations.</p>

		<h3>What is a BIM?</h3>
		<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">A Building Information Models or “BIM” is a detailed digital representation of a building design process. A BIM allows designers, contractors, developers, manufacturers and engineers to share data and construction information easily and efficiently, locating potential conflicts between different design plans and providing a valuable model for building owners that significantly reduces maintenance costs over the life of the building. Models can also be utilized for Scheduling and Estimation purposes too. </p>
		<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">While adapting to the advantages BIM offers requires investment in staff, processes, and technology, as well as requiring increased collaboration between the design teams. Nonetheless, the advantages are apparent.</p>

		<h3>BIM advantages</h3>

		<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">The use of BIM can results in data-rich as-built models that contain a wealth of information for smarter building operations:</p>

		<ul><b>•	Architects can produce more accurate designs with fewer errors, less waste, and closer alignment to the owner’s vision.</ul>
		<ul><b>•	Engineers can increase coordination with architects and other engineering disciplines, improving the reliability of their designs.</ul> 
		<ul><b>•	Contractors can make sure that constructability issues are flagged early on when changes are less expensive to make. </ul>
		<ul><b>•	Owners will be able to use the models far into the future as the basis of a comprehensive facilities and asset management program.</ul> 

		<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">BIM has translated into overall efficiency gains in the construction process of between 7% and 20%. Since the UK Government established its BIM Task Group in 2011 it has experienced an 18% improvement in the productivity on its projects.  Specific improvements occur through:</p>

		<ul><b>•	Improved visualization</b></ul>
		<ul><b>•	Improved productivity due to easy retrieval of information </b></ul>
		<ul><b>•	Conflict detection and analysis at design phase</b></ul>
		<ul><b>•	Increased coordination of construction documents</b></ul>
		<ul><b>•	Embedding and linking of vital information such as vendors for specific materials, location of details and quantities required for estimation and tendering</b></ul>
		<ul><b>•	Increased speed of delivery</b></ul>
		<ul><b>•	Reduced costs</b></ul>

		<h3>BIM means global collaboration</h3>
		<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">BIM technologies have revolutionized global collaboration in architecture and construction. Open collaboration workflow through BIM servers now allow for multiple location real-time support in a truly virtual environment. 
		<h3>BIM in New Zealand</h3>
		<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify"><b>2013 Maserspec survey shows 90% of NZ architects expect to use BIM within 5 years</b></p>
		<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">According to the recent 2013 Masterspec New Zealand BIM Survey 57% of NZ architects are already using BIM today, with 95% reporting that they expect to be using BIM within 5 years. </p>
		<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">With government initiatives in the US and Europe supporting BIM adoption, and the New Zealand government making BIM the centerpiece of its Productivity Partnership (to improve construction sector productivity by 20% by 2020), the full migration toward BIM adoption in New Zealand is imminent. BIM has arrived and has created exciting new opportunities for those who are first to make the transition to full BIM design and management.</p>
		<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify">According to NZ Minister for Building and Construction, Hon. Mautrice Williamson:</p>
		<p class="lead wp wp-2 text-justify"><i>“BIM or Building Information Modelling promises to be a game changer in lifting the productivity of New Zealand’s building and construction sector.”</i></p>
